# Hello World!  Filip here.

I'm a 5th year IT student at Silesian University of Technology. This is my official GitHub where I post my work, currently a merger of other platforms.

- 🧠 I’m currently learning backward compatibility for apps in whole windows os family and usage of python in AI and any type of network and data-flow testing.
